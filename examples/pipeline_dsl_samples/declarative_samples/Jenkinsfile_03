/*
'checkout scm' is a great single line to add to your script that checks out the source the Jenkinsfile 
is taken from. Otherwise use the 'git' function.
'checkout scm' clones without doing anything, but by default it is (probably) cloned to the Jenkins
Master workspace. Therefore, if the build node is not the master, the source code to be built does
not exist in the slave workspace.
