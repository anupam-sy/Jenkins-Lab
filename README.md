# Jenkins Lab
Jenkins is an open-source automation tool, written in Java with plugins built for continuous integration/continuous delivery and deployment (CI/CD). This lab contains jenkins related stuffs.

## Prerequisites
Jenkins requires Java in order to run. Please note, some Java versions are incompatible with Jenkins. Check official jenkins documentation for compatible version.

To install the Java on Ubuntu, Please follow below commands:

```
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y openjdk-11-jre
    java –version
```

Follow [Java-Installation](./docs/install_java.md) guide to install the Open JRE.

## Installation
The version of Jenkins included with the default Ubuntu packages is often behind the latest available version from the project itself.
To ensure the latest fixes and features, use the project-maintained packages to install Jenkins.

```
    # Add the repository key to your system
    wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add

    # Append the Debian package repository address to the server’s sources.list
    sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'

    # Update the apt repository and install Jenkins
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install jenkins

    sudo systemctl start jenkins # Enable the Jenkins service to start at boot
    sudo systemctl start jenkins # Start the Jenkins service
    sudo systemctl status jenkins # Check the status of Jenkins service
```

**Note:** Jenkins is typically run as a standalone application in its own process. The Jenkins WAR file bundles Winstone, a Jetty servlet container wrapper, and can be started on any operating system or platform with a version of Java supported by Jenkins.
